## 🧠 Topics Covered
- **Linear Algebra** — vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, SVD
- **Calculus** — limits, derivatives, gradients, integrals
- **Probability & Statistics** — distributions, Bayes’ theorem, inference
- **Optimization** — cost functions, gradient descent, convexity
- **Discrete Math** — logic, sets, graphs
- **Numerical Methods** — approximation, iteration, stability

## 📁 Repo Structure
Each topic folder includes:
- `README.md` → Index of the repo 
- `notes.md` → Key concepts & formulas  
- `examples.ipynb` → Python demos  
- `exercises.md` → Practice problems  
- Tagged by source (IITM BS or others) for traceability
